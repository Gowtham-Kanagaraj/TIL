#### What is data structure?

A data structure is a way to organise data so that it can be used effectively, They help to manage and organise data.

#### Choose a programming language?

You'll need to choose a programming language for the coding interviews you do, but you'll also need to find a language that you can use to study computer science concepts.

Preferably the language would be the same, so that you only need to be proficient in one.

I choose **Python**



[python.md](../python.md "mention"): Modern and very expressive, I learned it because it's just super useful and also allows me to write less code in an interview.

#### &#x20;Do Coding Interview Questions While You're Learning <a href="#user-content-3-do-coding-interview-questions-while-youre-learning" id="user-content-3-do-coding-interview-questions-while-youre-learning"></a>

Start doing coding interview questions while you're learning data structures and algorithms.

You need to apply what you're learning to solve problems, or you'll forget. I made this mistake.
