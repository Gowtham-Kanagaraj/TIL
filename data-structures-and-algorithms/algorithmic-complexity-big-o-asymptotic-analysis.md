# Algorithmic complexity / Big-O / Asymptotic analysis

No need to implement anything here, Your main focus should be on understanding how to express algorithmic complexity in terms of Big-O notation.

#### Big O Notation?

Big - O notation gives an upper bound of the complexity in the worst case, helping to quantify the performance as the input size becomes arbitrarily large.
